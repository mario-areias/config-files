My configurations files for MAC and Ubuntu. Of course, don't forget to move those files for your home folder or create symlinks to those files

For mac, it is required:

- Homebrew: http://brew.sh/

- Git Completation: https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash

- NPM: https://npmjs.org/

- bashmarks: https://github.com/huyng/bashmarks

For ubuntu, you need to install only the bashmarks and also git. Apart from that, nothing else is required
